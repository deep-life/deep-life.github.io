				The overall problem of Q8-prediction remains a challenge inthe field.   Recent advancement for AlphaFold established abenchmark during CASP14 with score of 92.4 out of 100 forGlobal Distance Test.  Given the complexity of this problem,we omit the exact positioning of the structure for the purposesof this publication and focus just on whether it appears in anygiven sequence or no. </br>

				The Feedback Network was implemented as a multi-labelclassifier.   More  specifically,  the  last  layer  of  the  networkconsists of eight nodes, each with sigmoid activation and thenetwork utilizes the binary cross-entropy loss.  Given the se-quence, language-like, nature of the problem we implementedan architecture that combines combine an embedding layer,bidirectional LSTMs, and a time-distributed output.

				Generative Adversarial Network was pre-trained on over 23,000 real sequences. The hyperparameters were
				chosen based on the training loss of the generator and the discriminator, the converging gradient penalty,
				and the resemblence of the generated outputs to the real sequences.
